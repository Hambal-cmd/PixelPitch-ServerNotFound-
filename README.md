# PixelPitch-ServerNotFound-
This is a simple prototype of a false apps and apks tracker.

It has been developed on MERN stack. For now the Data has been hardcoded into the backend. 

Backend:
    Major of the logic rests in index.js file.
    The hardcoded data is present in data.js file.

    It uses CORS middleware for resource sharing between the backend and frontend. As the frontend and backend are operating on 2 different ports.
    It uses REST api to fetch data from the backend.

Frontend:
    A react application with simple buttons and a tabular output.
    Majority of the logic is saved in the App.js.
    Styling has been done in App.css file.

This is the first prototype and has many area's of improvement.
    1-Mongo DB datablase connection.
    2-Admin and user authentication.
    3-More complex logic, way for user to input new data.
    4-Admin control over which data is truly a fisshy application.
